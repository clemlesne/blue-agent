KEDA detected, your pipelines agents will scale based on your usage. When you won't use them, they will be automatically removed.
{{- else -}}
KEDA not configured, your pipelines agents cannot be autoscaled. Pipelines can still be used, but their quantity will remain constant. This configuration is supported but not recommended (for reasons of developer experience and FinOps). You can install KEDA on Azure (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/keda-about) or others (https://keda.sh/docs/2.10/deploy).
