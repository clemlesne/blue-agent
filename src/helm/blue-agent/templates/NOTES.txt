‚úÖ KEDA detected, your pipelines agents will scaled based on your usage.
{{- else -}}
‚ö†Ô∏è KEDA not configured, your pipelines agents cannot be autoscaled. Pipelines can still be used, but their quantity will remain constant. This configuration is supported but not recommended (for reasons of developer experience and FinOps). You can install KEDA on Azure (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/keda-about) or others (https://keda.sh/docs/2.10/deploy).
